# google-api-php-docs
A (very) modest attempt to understand the google-api-php-client library

I'm struggling to understand how to use the official [google-api-php-client](https://github.com/google/google-api-php-client) library.  There are some [examples](https://github.com/google/google-api-php-client), but I have not been able to figure out how to execute a basic web search by looking at these.  My limited ability to learn how to use a library just from the source code is probably the biggest factor here, so [I've reached out to Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41592249/how-to-use-php-client-for-google-custom-search-engine) for some help.

I haven't found any documentation on this api elsewhere so I used phpdoc to generate some for the client and the services packages:

* [apiclient phpdocs](https://doub1ejack.github.io/vendor/google/apiclient/phpdoc/index.html)
* apiclient-services phpdocs (not yet documented)

The apiclient-services are remarkably large and after an 90 minutes phpdoc was still documenting services starting with "A", so I'm going to wait until I'm certain I need to see that documentation.
